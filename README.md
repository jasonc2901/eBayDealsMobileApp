# ebay_deals_app

A multi-platform Flutter App designed to simplify the process of checking daily deals on eBay.

## About this app

This project is a continuation from my previously created eBay Web Scraper. 

I created a Python Rest API using Flask and returned the deals retrieved from my web scraper. I have since deployed this and the code for this has not been included within this repository. 

This application is created using the Flutter Dart framework and has Firebase Authentication implemented in order to create a reliable user Signup/Login environment.

Once signed in the user will be greeted with the Homepage, this is where they will see the deals split into multiple categories such as deals under Â£10, Biggest Savings etc.

Feel free to download this app and run it on your own devices!
